Objective is to build a cost-effective VGA interface using atmega16 which should be capable of displaying some sort of image as for the proof of concept. The VGA signals are generated using the timers of microcontroller, which are also connected back to the microcontroller in order trigger an interrupt. Upon the interrupt, the microcontroller pushes the image stored in program space on to the data pin of VGA connector (DB-15). The image resolution we realized is 160x80 monochromatic image on screen resolution of 640x480 with refresh rate of 60Hz. The program code was drafted on AVR Studio 5.1, simulated on Proteus 8 and hex file was burned using standard ISP Programmer.
